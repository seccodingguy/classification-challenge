# Author: Mark Wireman

## Introduction
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is interested in improving the email filtering system for its customers. A provided dataset contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP is in support of developing a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

## Summary

The Random Forest model performed better by 0.2 compared to the Logistic Regression model. This is likely due to the Random Forest will better perform because the model is specifically built for a binary prediction which fits a decision tree more efficiently.
